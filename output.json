Eligible members must be at least 18 years old, have a BMI of 35 or higher with related comorbidities, and demonstrate unsuccessful medical treatment for obesity. Covered procedures include various types of gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy, while certain procedures, such as adjustable gastric banding and intestinal bypass surgery, are excluded due to insufficient evidence of their long-term efficacy. The policy also specifies that coverage is contingent upon receiving treatment at contracted facilities and may require pre-authorization.",
  "1": "The Molina Clinical Policy (MCP) outlines the guidelines for the use of Epidural Steroid Injections (ESIs) in treating back and neck pain, emphasizing that these policies are not treatment recommendations but rather criteria for determining medical necessity and payment eligibility. ESIs may be considered medically necessary for adults over 18 with specific conditions, such as radicular pain or post-surgical pain, provided they have failed conservative treatments and meet other outlined criteria. The policy also details the frequency and types of injections allowed, while specifying conditions under which ESIs are not authorized, such as non-radicular pain or excessive repeat injections. Additionally, the document highlights the importance of consulting individual benefit plans for coverage specifics and notes that regulatory guidelines from CMS take precedence over the MCP.",

It specifies that ESIs are considered medically necessary when certain criteria are met, including a documented history of pain lasting at least four weeks and failure of conservative treatments. The document also details limitations on the number of injections allowed per year, the necessity of imaging guidance during procedures, and contraindications for ESI use. Overall, while ESIs can provide short-term relief, the document emphasizes the need for careful patient selection and monitoring due to potential risks and the lack of long-term efficacy evidence.",
